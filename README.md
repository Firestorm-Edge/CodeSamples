A space for me to upload samples of code I've written for people to see.

Combat.cs is a game loop for the game Grid Masters, by Angry Hangar.  It is the most basic form of Combat in the game, and can be extended by other other classes to create different and more complex game modes.  This class manages the updating and drawing of characters, projectiles, the tile map, the HUD, and various background elements.  This class does NOT handle or enforce victory conditions, as that is something left to classes that might inherit from this one.
